# The Library
A prototype library web application that uses Django to display an organized assortment of books and being able to view the booksâ€™ details, users are able to view a variety of books by using a search bar or going to the specified genre page. Users are required to login/sign up for an account in order to borrow/return books, as well as viewing their borrow history to check when books can be or were returned. Staff members are able to add, manage, or remove books using the default admin page.

## Requirements
Must have Django and Pillow downloaded, if not run the command`pip install django pillow`. Recommended to install them on a virtual environment rather than the system to avoid conflicts with global pip packages.

## How to set up web application
1. Download the source code as a zip file and extract the zip to your preferred location
2. Open the folder in an IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code) and then run a terminal inside the folder
3. If you are creating a virtual environment, run the command `python -m venv <foldername>` inside the folder, then activate the virtual environment with `.\venv\Scripts\activate`. (This may be different for other systems)
4. Install requirements (from above)
5. Run `python manage.py runserver` inside the folder to run the server, then follow instructions on the terminal to open the server in your browser
